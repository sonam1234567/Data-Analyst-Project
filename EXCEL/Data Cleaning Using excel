# Cleaning of the raw data using the Excel.

1. The first step done is the creation of the raw data duplication
-> Doing so help us look back at the raw data or gather informations from it if we deleted any crucial data.


2. During the cleaning of the data we have too look into the following things first:
-> Duplcaite Data
For removing the duplicate data we have to goto the following steps after selecting all the column and data:
Data-> Data Cleanup -> Remove Duplicates

-> Formatting and standarization(For instance you want to make sure that all the name column of your data has the same cases 
caps or lower, check for spelling errors, additonal spaces.)
=>To make the column either lower or upper we do the following:
  =upper(select the cell)
=>For Trimming the whitespaces we can do:
Data-> Data Cleanup -> Trim whitespaces
=trim(select the cell)
=> Create filter just in case if there are groups and some groups are spelled inccorect we can correct it.

-> Look for symbols like $ and others as this might not let the data to be imported to SQL database correctly.


-> Look for the dates column and mke sure they are formatted correctly.
